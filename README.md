Introduction 

• The main goal of this project is to compare the experience and cost of eating out versus eating at home. I decided to focus on neighbourhood spots and brunch dishes to keep things simple. 
Added three supermarkets to do a price check. 

• In this project, variations arise between dining out and eating at home due to factors like recipe differences, variable product quantities, varying product quality, the social experience of  
dining out, labour considerations, and the ambience of the location. These environmental variables are consistent across all places considered. Recipes are sourced from BBC Good Food, and ingredients  
are obtained from Tesco, Morrison, and Sainsbury supermarkets. 

• I had four key questions on my radar, but the primary one was: 

      1)Eating out vs. Eating in? 
      According to my findings with Pancake, Avocado on Toast, and Full English Breakfast, making it at home is the cheaper way to do it. But when it comes to Egg Royal, treating yourself out might just 
      be worth it. 

      2)Is there any dish cheaper to eat out than to make it at home? 
      Going out or Egg Royale cheaper way to have it. The reason why there is a big price difference between Egg Royal and others is that it contains Smoked Salmon. 

      3) How are supermarkets competing with their prices? 
      Overall the cheapest Supermarket to buy all of the products, is Morrison £18.09, Sainsbury £20.64, and Tesco £20.84 . 

      4) What is the average dish price among the brunch places? 
      Comparison between dish prices The most expensive dish is Full English Breakfast, cheapest one is Avocado On Toast. 
      According to Full English Breakfast, the cheapest place to eat is Café 338, the most expensive place to eat at The Astro Cafe. 
      According to Avocado On Toast, the cheapest place Café 338, and the most expensive place to eat is The Astro. 
      Overall the comparison to cheapest to expensive Café 338 cheapest,  The Moonlight Cafe is in the middle band, and The Astro Cafe is the most expensive choice.
